% Some acknowledgements...

I am extremely grateful to my advisor Alex Wright for help and guidance throughout the course of my PhD.
He taught me how to keep on chipping away at a problem for months, and not to be discouraged by apparent lack of progress.
I would also like to thank Ralf Spatzier for many helpful conversations, as well as helping out with many of the bureaucratic requirements of a PhD program at short notice.
I am also grateful to the graduate students doing geometry and dynamics at Michigan, from whom I learnt a lot: in particular, thanks Bradley, Chris, Karen, Carsten, Katia, and Mitul.
Finally I'd like to thank my friends at Michigan for making sure I had a life outside of math as well: thanks Urshita, Anna, Karthik, Michael, Malavika, Sameer, Shelby, Danny, Lukas, and Havi.
