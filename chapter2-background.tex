Outline
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
\item Write about the basic facts of mapping class groups of non-orientable surfaces.
\item Write about Patterson-Sullivan theory: preliminaries, i.e. need a measure on the limit set.
\item Then write about construction, address uniqueness, convergence/divergence type.
\item List various theorems we might like about the measure.
\item Show construction of Bowen-Margulis measure, and the full statement of Hopf-Tsuji-Sullivan dichotomy.
\item Mixing of geodesic flow implies counting, and uniqueness of PS measure.
\end{enumerate}
